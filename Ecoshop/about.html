        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p>EcoShop was founded in 2018 by a group of environmentally-conscious friends who shared a passion for sustainable living. Frustrated by the lack of accessible and affordable eco-friendly products, they decided to create a platform that would make
            it easy for people to find and purchase sustainable alternatives. What started as a small online store quickly gained traction as more people embraced the idea of a greener lifestyle.</p>
        <p>In 2019, we expanded our product range to include a wider variety of eco-friendly items, from everyday household goods to unique gifts. By 2020, we had established partnerships with several sustainable brands, further enhancing our product offerings.
            Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, EcoShop remained committed to its mission, launching initiatives to support local communities and promote sustainability during these difficult times.</p>
        <p>Today, EcoShop continues to grow and evolve, driven by our commitment to making sustainable living accessible to everyone. We are proud of our journey and excited about the future as we work towards a more sustainable world, one product at a time.</p>
